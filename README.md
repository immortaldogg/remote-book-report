# What is remote work
Remote working means the worker get to choose his/her own workplace anywhere he/she wants. You can work from home or a cafe or a co-working place or even while you traveling, from early morning to noon or from noon to midnight. It is based on the concept that work does not need to be done in a specific place (the office) to be executed successfully. Many companies, even big ones (AT&T, Mercedes-Benz, Github, ect.) have been doing remote work and getting success.
<!-- - Remote working can only happen with the rise of technology, now people can share documents, do presentation or have a meeting with other people across the world through a computer. -->
# Why should we work remotely?
- The most important thing to consider a worker's performance is how much work he/she has done, not how they do it. Therefore, it doesn't matter where the worker works, an office or a cafe or at home, as long as the work is done.
- To check progress or have a meeting or collaborate with each others, we have the technology as Microsoft Teams, Slack, Skype, etc. to assist us. It doesn't need to happened in an office.
- One of the key thing to be productive is eleminating as much interruptions as possible and settle yourself into the productivity zone. Remote work offers the workers the choice to find their own zone instead of getting the office as the only place to work. The quality of the work will increase as the workers find their zone.
- Assuming the average time of commuting to office everyday is 1.5 hours, that's 400 hours a year, 400 hours is the total time of Basecamp build time, 400 hours is a lot of time wasted. With remote work, there will be less (or even no more) commuting, no more time wasted, for employers and employees, win-win.
- Employer can hire great talent from anywhere, bring great values to the company without worrying about space boundary.
- Remote working doesn't mean your chosen workplace will be permanent, it's not all or nothing. You can work at the office this week, traveling to Thailand and work there next week. This gives the worker the chance to do traveling, enjoying their life while working.
# How to work remotely?
To be a remote worker, you just need to be an responsible adult and a good writer.
## Collaborating
Remote work doesn't mean you work alone, you're still a team member. Make sure you have a overlap working time with others to avoid work blocking. Put all the work items out in the open so everyone can sees the progress and takes what they need for their work.
## Keep the wheel rolling
The flow of progressing information through the company is comforting. As an employer, you can make everyone feels like they're in that loop. One way is asking what did they do everyday or everyweek. "Simply put, progress is a joy best shared with coworkers."
## Be aware
Remote work gives you lots of goods and things, but there are also trade-offs. It gives you the freedom of time and space but it doesn't guarantee you will be productive, consistently.
- Cafe, co-working places or your home are just workplaces, just like the office, there will be distractions. Weâ€™re all human and we all occasionally fall prey to temptation. But you can deal with that, because you're a responsible adult. If you can't get the job done, then remote work is not for you.
- Mental health is a real thing. Working alone could lead you to be isolated. Having a conversation with your colleagues sometimes
- Without building a good routine, you could get your health into bad state, or letting your passion control you too much and get lost in the work, leading to burnout. Avoid working too much simply cause of driving of passion. 40 hours a week is enough.
